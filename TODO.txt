	- wrong sign on COGS:
		- ./examples/show_report.rb iaci 10-q -3
			Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Parent (NetIncomeLoss_0)
				[or] Revenues                                                        421,652,000.0

				[cogs] Cost Of Services Excluding Depreciation Depletion ...         188,642,000.0   (POSITIVE; INCORRECT)
		- looks like there's a warning:
			Warning: item "CostOfServicesExcludingDepreciationDepletionAndAmortization" doesn't have xbrl:balance 
			definition, which should be either 'credit' or 'debit'
	- show_reports doesn't check filing validity
	- show_reports should fall back to NOT showing items if there's 10k->10q error or if not valid

Forecasts

Income Statement
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- rename OIBT as OOIBT?
	- consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc.

Balance Sheet
	- I saw a case (ADBE? ORCL?) in which a non-leaf item had a value, and had 
	  two children with labels but no values.
