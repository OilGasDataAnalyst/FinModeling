Bugs
	- show_reports doesn't check filing validity

Cleanup
	- get rid of factories, now that caching works well.
	- the viterbi algorithm needlessly re-calculates the same probabilities 
	  over and over. Seems like we could flip the order of the loops and save
	  a ton of time: first generate the probabilities of states for each step;
	  second, scan through the probabilities and guess at states.

Forecasts

Income Statement
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- rename OIBT as OOIBT?
	- consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc.

Balance Sheet
	- I saw a case (ADBE? ORCL?) in which a non-leaf item had a value, and had 
	  two children with labels but no values.
