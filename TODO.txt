Bugs
	- show_reports doesn't check filing validity
	- show_reports should fall back to NOT showing items if there's 10k->10q error or if not valid

Forecasts

Income Statement
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- rename OIBT as OOIBT?
	- consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc.

Balance Sheet
	- I saw a case (ADBE? ORCL?) in which a non-leaf item had a value, and had 
	  two children with labels but no values.
