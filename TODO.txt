Bump the schema versions (e.g., in 10K and 10Q reports)
Try to figure out why the change in equity is not equal to comprehensive income, in cases where we know it.
	- Some 10k's (and even some 10q's?) have Statements of SE
	- When they don't:
		- Some 10q's have AOCI broken out on BS. We can look for deltas
		- Some 10q's have disclosures that list components of OCI or CI
		- The remaining residual is probably stock-based compensation expense

Statement of Shareholder Equity
	- Parse this one to get at comprehensive income

Forecasts
	- Choosing of policies should probably be bumped to a higher-level package.
	- Need more sophisticated forecasting policies
	- Need to have more sophisticated policies fall back on simpler ones (or none) when there's
	  too much chaos

Bugs
	- Not all disclosures *begin* with disclosure.  See CRM's most recent 10-K, for instance.
	- The "valid vals" thing should hides gaps in data, which silently&crappily affect the regressions.
	- show_reports doesn't check filing validity

Income Statement
	- Dig into the disclosures. They've got lots more interesting goodness.
	- It'd be interesting to try to correct for cyclicality.
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- naming consistency (e.g., rename OIBT as OOIBT?)
	- consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc.

Balance Sheet
	- Dig into the disclosures. They've got lots more interesting goodness.
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?

Cash Flow Statement
	- Dig into the disclosures. They've got lots more interesting goodness.
	- not taking into account: net cash interest, tax on net interest, or non-cash
	  transactions.  All 3 of these items are listed in supplementary disclosures.
	- the classifier's success rate isn't that high.
	- "I" is defined inversely.
