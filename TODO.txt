Comprehensive Income Statement
	- Include it in the restated income statement
	- Not very many examples, especially of less common things like FIAT. Find more.

XBRL items can include Footnotes. Should probably print these out.

Income Statement
	- In IncomeStatement::latest_quarterly_refactored, it's checking whether the statement has any
	  quarterly periods, and if so, using the last one. There's a problem with that, some statements
	  do have quarterly periods, but don't break all lines down to the quarterly level. In this example:
		./examples/show_reports.rb --income-detail CHRW 2011-09-01
	  The 2012-12-31 column is missing a $283M income (FIBT) because that item is only given in annual
	  periods (not the 2012-10-01..2012-12-31 quarterly period). See it in this dump:
		./examples/dump_latest_10k.rb http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1043277/000104327713000004/0001043277-13-000004-index.htm
	  Need to modify that method to check whether there are quarterly PERIODS and that all leaf items
	  have that quarterly period.
	- Improve the readability of the error checking. One option would be to move to
	  a system like ActiveRecord's error-handling, in which a class just accumulates its errors 
	  nicely, and lets you print them out whenever it's convenient, and in a well-formatted way, 
	  without causing an immediate exception.
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
	  (I don't even remember what this refers to...)
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE? and/or parse the comprehensive
	  income statement.
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc. (not a big deal for tech companies, but important for conglomerates, mediaco's, etc)
	- naming consistency (e.g., rename OIBT as OOIBT?)
	- naming consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- Instead of having find_calculation_arc use a discrete set of exact regexes, what about using
	  a classifier (and minimum confidence threshold), like the row classifier works?
	- How to tell if a stock gave off a dividend? Are we tracking those somewhere?

Forecasts
	- Refactor it. The logic is too spread around. Let the user control whether to use
	  trend, mean, or industry-avg's
	- Detect historicals that are too noisy to forecast from:
		- R^2 of regressions?
		- Certain ratios remaining constant-ish (e.g, composition ratios)
	- Detect historicals with poor earnings quality:
		- Noisy NI/C
	- Detect forecasts that look suspect:
		- Derived values in the forecasts (e.g., composition ratio) remain 
		  with a standard deviation or two from their trend lines.
	- Allow assumptions to be tweaked by user: 
		- How is continuing value calculated? (What long-term g?)

Balance Sheet
	- Dig into the disclosures. They've got lots more interesting goodness.
	- Need to reclassify: credits to shareholders' equity for stock compensation expense
	- Minority interest?
	- Need to reclassify: dividends payable
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
	- "Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Equity Carrying Amount"??

Try to figure out why the change in equity is not equal to comprehensive income, in cases where we know it.
	- Some 10k's (and even some 10q's?) have Statements of SE
	- When they don't:
		- Some 10q's have AOCI broken out on BS. We can look for deltas
		- Some 10q's have disclosures that list components of OCI or CI
		- The remaining residual is probably stock-based compensation expense
	- minority interests makes it screwey. also, preferred dividends?

Disclosures
	- Not all disclosure titles *begin* with /^disclosure/.  See CRM's most recent 10-K, for instance.

Cash Flow Statement
	- not taking into account: net cash interest, tax on net interest, or non-cash
	  transactions.  All 3 of these items are listed in supplementary disclosures.
	- the classifier's success rate isn't that high.
	- "I" is defined inversely.

Reformulated Statement of Shareholder Equity

Statement of Shareholder Equity
	- Not taking into account share-based compensation, dividends payable, etc.

Cost of Capital
	- Debt cost of capital - try to estimate before tax cost of capital by modeling
	  credit spread as a function of interest coverage. Is there a way to estimate
	  marginal (not effective) tax rate?
