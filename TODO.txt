Bugs
	- show_reports doesn't check filing validity
	- Not all filings have quarterly summaries. Need a generalized way of 
      constructing quarterly summaries from whatever latest periods *do* exist.

Forecasts

Cash Flow Statemen
	- not taking into account: net cash interest, tax on net interest, or non-cash
	  transactions.  All 3 of these items are listed in supplementary disclosures.
	- the classifier's success rate isn't that high.

Income Statement
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- naming consistency (e.g., rename OIBT as OOIBT?)
	- consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc.
