Forecasts
	- Need more sophisticated forecasting policies
	- Need to have more sophisticated policies fall back on simpler ones (or none) when there's
	  too much chaos

Bugs
	- The "valid vals" thing should hides gaps in data, which silently&crappily affect the regressions.
	- "./examples/show_reports.rb nflx 2010-10-01" is reporting a crazy Core OI in last quarter
	- show_reports doesn't check filing validity

Cleanup
	- The *Analyses doesn't feel right to me, modeling-wise.

Cash Flow Statement
	- not taking into account: net cash interest, tax on net interest, or non-cash
	  transactions.  All 3 of these items are listed in supplementary disclosures.
	- the classifier's success rate isn't that high.
	- "I" is defined inversely.

Income Statement
	- It'd be interesting to try to correct for cyclicality.
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- naming consistency (e.g., rename OIBT as OOIBT?)
	- consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc.

Balance Sheet
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
