Forecasts
	* Filtering bogus growth values and then regressing is going to ignore the 
	  times when NOA flips from pos to neg (or vice versa), which is going to 
	  lead to material errors. Better to regress on the raw NOA values and use
	  those to predict future NOA. Then sign changes aren't problematic.
	- Detect historicals that are too noisy to forecast from:
		- R^2 of regressions?
		- Certain ratios remaining constant-ish (e.g, composition ratios)
	- Detect historicals with poor earnings quality:
		- Noisy NI/C
	- Detect forecasts that look suspect:
		- Derived values in the forecasts (e.g., composition ratio) remain 
		  with a standard deviation or two from their trend lines.

Cost of Capital
	- Fama/French equity cost of capital is producing very noisy results. Some
	  R_e's are negative, some arein the 30-40% range. Why? And if that's not
	  fixable, use something simpler like CAPM. Or do both and take the one that's
	  more plausible?
	- Debt cost of capital - try to estimate before tax cost of capital by modeling
	  credit spread as a function of interest coverage. Is there a way to estimate
	  marginal (not effective) tax rate?

Income Statement
	- Fix the half-implemented error checking. I'd like it to work like ActiveRecord,
	  where a class just accumulates its errors nicely, and lets you print them out
	  whenever it's convenient, and in a well-formatted way, without causing an 
	  immediate exception.
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
	  (I don't even remember what this refers to...)
	- net income != comprehensive income.  pull in items from SSE?
	- certain things are being misclassified as FIBT instead of OOIBT. (hedging, 
	  currency exchg, etc)
	- need to better understand minority interest, noncontrollable blah-blah,
	  etc. (not a big deal for tech companies, but important for conglomerates, mediaco's, etc)
	- naming consistency (e.g., rename OIBT as OOIBT?)
	- naming consistency between operating/financing vs. operational/financial?
	- Instead of having find_calculation_arc use a discrete set of exact regexes, what about using
	  a classifier (and minimum confidence threshold), like the row classifier works?

Balance Sheet
	- Dig into the disclosures. They've got lots more interesting goodness.
	- The classifier that had been classifying unknown credits/debits is disabled. Replace it?
	- "Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Equity Carrying Amount"??

Try to figure out why the change in equity is not equal to comprehensive income, in cases where we know it.
	- Some 10k's (and even some 10q's?) have Statements of SE
	- When they don't:
		- Some 10q's have AOCI broken out on BS. We can look for deltas
		- Some 10q's have disclosures that list components of OCI or CI
		- The remaining residual is probably stock-based compensation expense
	- minority interests makes it screwey. also, preferred dividends?

Disclosures
	- Not all disclosure titles *begin* with /^disclosure/.  See CRM's most recent 10-K, for instance.

Cash Flow Statement
	- not taking into account: net cash interest, tax on net interest, or non-cash
	  transactions.  All 3 of these items are listed in supplementary disclosures.
	- the classifier's success rate isn't that high.
	- "I" is defined inversely.

Reformulated Statement of Shareholder Equity

Statement of Shareholder Equity
	- Not taking into account share-based compensation, dividends payable, etc.
